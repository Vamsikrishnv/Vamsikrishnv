What I’ve Done

I Build AI That Works in Production
I specialize in **designing, deploying, and scaling AI/ML systems** — from fine-tuning large language models to orchestrating multi-agent workflows that automate real-world business operations.

- LLM Applications** — LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen  
- RAG Pipelines** — Pinecone, Snowflake Cortex, Vector Search Optimization  
- Model Training & Fine-Tuning** — GPT, LLaMA, Hugging Face, Vertex AI, SageMaker  
- Cloud AI Deployments** — AWS, GCP, CI/CD for ML, MLOps best practices  
- End-to-End AI Products** — From research → prototype → production API

## What I’m Working On

Right now, I’m deep into:
- Building **AI Agents** that plan, remember, and automate — fitness, SEO, personal scheduling, and more
- Integrating **LangChain**, **Ollama**, **OpenAI GPT-4o**, and **n8n** into real-world task flows
- Structuring production-ready **LLM APIs** using Spring Boot + FastAPI
- Experimenting with **open-source LLMs** + vector search (Pinecone, Weaviate, Amazon Bedrock)

## What I’m Looking For

I'm actively seeking **Full-Time Engineering Roles** where I can:
- Solve real-world problems using **LLMs, AI Workflows, and Full Stack Engineering**
- Work on GenAI product teams building **AI agents, developer platforms, or AI-native SaaS**
- Collaborate with visionaries in **top global tech companies** or cutting-edge AI startups
